## Sending Spout

This is done with the **Spout sender** node which has can send texture either from the Game viewport or from a Render Targert 2D: 
  * **Game Viewport** sends the image of the viewport, but please note that it doesn't work in standalone or packaged game.
  * **TextureRenderTarget2D** in which case you should create a _SceneCaptureComponent2D_ and a *Render target 2D* which you should reference in the node.

use **Close Sender** node to close Spouts. The best way is to connect it to **Event EndPlay** node.

## Install Example

* Create new C++ *First Person* project
* unzip ExampleSpout.zip in the "Content" folder of your project
* unzip code plugin in folder "Plugins" as mentioned above, if there is no "Plugins" folder, create it
* restart project
* load Spout scene
* if you encounter compile errors you have to delete and re-insert identical nodes

## Packaged game
To make this plugin work in a packaged game you have to disable using 'pak' files. You do that by:
1. going to File->Package project->Packaging settings
2. once there uncheck 'Use Pak File' checkbox

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is only necessary if you are using the *Mat* pin on the *Spout Receiver* node.

# Issues
If you get missing Spout.dll error when trying to launch the game manually copy Spout.dll from:
[gameName]\Plugins\SpoutUE4\ThirdParty\Spout\lib\amd64

to: 
[gameName]\Binaries\Win64
