## Sending Spout

<<<<<<< HEAD
the "spout sender" has two options: 
  * "Game Viewport" that send the image of the viewport (doesn't work in standalone game) 
  * or use a "TextureRenderTarget2D" in this case you should create a "SceneCaptureComponent2D"
=======
This is done with the **Spout sender** node which has can send texture either from the Game viewport or from a Render Targert 2D: 
  * **Game Viewport** sends the image of the viewport, but please note that it doesn't work in standalone or packaged game.
  * **TextureRenderTarget2D** in which case you should create a _SceneCaptureComponent2D_ and a *Render target 2D* which you should reference in the node.

use **Close Sender** node to close Spouts. The best way is to connect it to **Event EndPlay** node.

To make this plugin work in a packaged game you have to disable using 'pak' files. You do that by:
1. going to File->Package project->Packaging settings
2. once there uncheck 'Use Pak File' checkbox

# Issues
If you get missing Spout.dll error when trying to launch the game manually copy Spout.dll from:
[gameName]\Plugins\SpoutUE4\ThirdParty\Spout\lib\amd64

to: 
[gameName]\Binaries\Win64

**If someone knows how to fix this, please let me know!**

=======
This is only necessary if you are using the *Mat* pin on the *Spout Receiver* node.
